#### Goal

The purpose of this assignment is to build a simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  application which reads its configration data from a Github repo. Second, you will learn how to dockerize your application.

#### Pre-requisites
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).
* [A Linux Bash Shell for Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)
    
#### I - Docker Setup

* [1] Install [Docker]
* [2] Create a Github repo called "cmpe273-assignment1" and clone the repo to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/{your_username}/cmpe273-assignment1
cd cmpe273-assignment1
```

* [3] Create *requirements.txt* file and add this line to the file.
```sh
flask
```

* [4] Create a Python script *app.py* file and add these code to the file.
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello from Dockerized Flask App!!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0')
```


* [5] Create a Docker file *Dockerfile* without any file extension and add these lines to the file.
```sh
FROM python:2.7.13
MAINTAINER Your Name "yourname@gmail.com"
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

* [6] Run this command inside the cmpe273-assignment1 working directory. Make sure you have all these files in the current directory: Dockerfile, app.py, and requirements.txt
```sh
docker build -t assignment1-flask-app:latest .
```

* [7] Run this Docker command to list all images.
```sh
docker images
```

* [8] Run the Docker container using the image you created in the previous step.
```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 assignment1-flask-app
```

* [9] Lookup IP of the assignment1-flask-app container.
```sh
docker-machine ls
# OR 
docker-machine ip default
```
```sh
NAME      ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS
default   *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v1.11.1   
tester    -        virtualbox   Saved                                         Unknown   
```
> Example: Under the "URL" column, "192.168.99.100" is the IP of your container.

* [10] Open this URL in a web browser. If you see the Hello message, you can now commit all three files into your Github repo (cmpe273-lab1).

```sh
http://{IP_FROM_STEP_9}:5000/
```

#### II - Build a sample application that pulls configuration from a Github repo. 

* Integrate with Github to pull application configuration from a [config repo](https://github.com/sithu/assignment1-config-example) which has a set of YML files with {environment}-config.yml format.

_YAML Type Example_

```sh
curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/v1/dev-config.yml

welcome_message: "Hello from Dockerized Flask App"

curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/v1/test-config.yml

welcome_message: "Hello from Dockerized Flask App Test"
```

_JSON Type Example_

```sh
curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/v1/dev-config.json
{
    "welcome_message": "Hello from Dockerized Flask App"
}

curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/v1/test-config.json
{
    "welcome_message": "Hello from Dockerized Flask App Test"
}
```

If you commit any changes to the [config repo], the above responses should return the latest changes.

* Your application should take the Github repo URL as a command line argument.

_Running your app without Docker_
```sh
$python app.py https://github.com/sithu/assignment1-config-example
```

* Update your *Dockerfile* from I.[5] step so that you can pass a GitHub repo URL from _docker run_ command.

```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 assignment1-flask-app https://github.com/sithu/assignment1-config-example
```
